Dear Tutors,
as you probably already noticed, our code for this weeks homework is not working. 
We have tried multiple different ways to implement our code/ideas, however, end up in a similar issue as the one our uploaded code has: the system crashes. This occurred for all three of our laptops. 
We are not sure why this occurred and our research on the matter came up blank. 
We hope the homework is stillÂ acceptable.
